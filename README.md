`ICTA Interview`

The Idea of the project has been broken down into two parts: frontend, backend 
The frontend is used with React, so to run the command, you have to use `npm run dev` for the backend `node index.js`

`Note:`
JWT token is being used since there is no authentication. I didn't do any authentication work. Database configuration has also been done. You have to give your database URL in the .env file.
