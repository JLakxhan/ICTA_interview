`ICTA Interview`

The Idea of the project has been broken down into two parts: frontend, backend 
The frontend is used with React, so to run the command, you have to use `npm run dev` for the backend `node index.js`

`Note:`

JWT token is being used since there is no authentication. I didn't do any authentication work. So I have commented on that code part. Database configuration has also been done. You have to give your database URL in the .env file.


try and catch block is being added, but logs are not added since this is a small task.
